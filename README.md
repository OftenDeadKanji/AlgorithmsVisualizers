# AlgorithmsVisualizers

The application allows the user to see how specific algorithms work. Currently, there are available **4 sorting algorithms** - Bubble, Insertion, Quick and Heap, and **2 path finding algorithms** - Dijkstra and A*.

User can choose the algorithm, array/board size and latency of algorithm iterations. For Path Finding algorithms, the user can also create the board by setting the start, end and obstacles cells.

Below you can see how the application looks like.
